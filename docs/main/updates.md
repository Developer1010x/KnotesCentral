This project is still in its early stages and has a long way to go. We are looking for your contributions to make this project better.

## Credits

`Welcome to the Notes Website, a collaborative platform designed to support students in their academic journey at our college. As we near graduation, we want to ensure that this resource remains valuable and up-to-date for future batches. Here's how we can achieve that:`

## Continuous Updates and Contributions

- This website connects to shared drives where all the notes, previous years' question papers, and other resources are stored. To keep the content current and relevant:
  - **Batch Contributions**: After we graduate, we encourage our batch mates, as well as juniors, to continue updating the drives with new notes and resources. This collaborative effort will benefit everyone.
  - **List of Contributors**: We maintain a list of contributors who have editor access to the drive. If you need to update the content, please contact the nearest senior or junior from this list to gain editor access. The list will be regularly updated to reflect active contributors.
  - **Structured Content**: We aim to maintain a structured format for the notes and resources in the drive. This will make it easier for students to find what they need quickly. If you are uploading new content, please follow the existing structure.
  - **How to Contribute**:
    - **Contact Us**: To become a contributor, reach out to a current contributor from the list. They will guide you on gaining editor access and the guidelines for updating the content.
    - **Add New Content**: When adding new content, please follow the existing structure to maintain consistency. Label your notes and resources clearly with course names and relevant details.

> Thank you for your contributions and commitment to making this website a lasting resource. Also, feel free to clone the drive (whose link will be in the sheet) and create your own if the website is not updated. Additionally, you can clone the website too
